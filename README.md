# Blackjack-elm

This project aims the development of a basic blackjack web app.  Initially I was given some starting(boilerplate) code, which you I completed in order to obtain a functional application.The user of the app should be able to click on a button to draw a card and the drawn cards(the user’s hand) should be shown as huge unicode characters.  The user should also be able totoggle with a second button whether the cards remaining in the deck should also be shown ornot.  The user should see their current score and a message when they win (obtain a score of21) or lose (obtain a score over 21) the game.
